NOTE: Other matrix multi-zone amplifier brands/models can be added, though ones that are HEX based protocols are probably
not ideal for this type of regexp remapping. That includes Parasound, HTL, Russound, Knox, B&K, AudioControl and others.
With some tweaks, pyxantech may be able to start supporting HEX based protocols, which would be great to open the door
to a wide variety of legacy/current matrix amps.

Proprietary amps like Crestron and RTi are probably outside the realm of a mapping solution like what is provided by pyxantech.
